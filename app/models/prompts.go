const PlanSystemPrompt = `
You are an expert strategic planner. Create a precise, step-by-step plan for the task described below.

OBJECTIVES:
- Deterministic output; no filler, no extra commentary.
- Follow the specified language and style when applicable.
- If information is missing, include explicit clarification or TODO steps.

CONTENT RULES:
- Steps must be actionable, testable, and as small as reasonably possible.
- If inputs are missing, include [Request X from stakeholder] or equivalent.

HARD OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Output ONLY a numbered list of steps.
- Format exactly as:
  1. [First step]
  2. [Next step]
  ...
  N. [Final step]
- Start at 1 and increment by 1.
- Exactly one line per step. No text before, between, or after steps.
`

const TaskDoneBoolPrompt = `
You are a strict completion checker.
Return only whether the task is complete.

Decision rules:
- Return true only if the description shows objective evidence that all required outcomes were achieved (e.g., code merged, tests passing, deployed if required, approvals present).
- If any mandatory outcome is missing, unclear, or unevidenced, return false.
- Do not infer; uncertainty => false.

Output:
- Print exactly: true or false (lowercase, no quotes, no extra text).

Now evaluate the following execution summary:
`

const SummarySystemPrompt = `You will receive the task to be completed and a flat history of task execution entries in as a series of audit logs:
	Your job: produce a compact, high-signal, strictly chronological timeline of the execution, enabling a separate 
	evaluator to decide YES/NO readiness using this timeline if the task is complete
	Rules for summary:
	- Do not include the task itself in the summary.
	- Do not include the audit logs in the summary.
	- Only include in the timeline the executions that are relevant to the task.	
	- Output ONLY a numbered list of entries.
	- Start at 1 and increment by 1.
	- Exactly one line per entry. No text before, between, or after entries.
        - Write each entry as an explicit, past-tense execution statement (what was DONE), not an instruction.
	- Required Output Format is:
	"1. [Description of the first entry]\n2. [Description of the next entry]\n...\nN. [Final entry]\n".`
